            as "Agents", all with their own unique set of abilities, creating combinations of abilities to be used together more effectively, maps that cater towards abilites strengths, and possible
            counter abilities that create weaknesses. Players need to carefully choose a group of agents that work well together, are effective on the map selected, and contribute to the team's
